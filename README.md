Compatible with Unity 6.

You can add this as a git submodule to your Unity project. For instance Assets/Scripts/Basics.

Dependencies:
- [Tri-Inspector](https://github.com/codewriter-packages/Tri-Inspector)
- TextMeshPro (not yet, but will be after I merged some stuff from the Basics folder in another project)
